some exercises for technical interviews
The idea behind it is to bring questions that I had to solve when being interviewed for technical roles such data scientist, data/business analyst, product owner. The compilation of this data aims to help people that are looking for their first experience or people who was not interviewing for a time by sharing with them what has been asked in the market. I try to apply to jobs to get interviews and be able to access the technical questions to be able to bring the latest hiring trends.
